# airline-check-in
Collection of Python scripts using Selenium to check passengers into airlines

## Southwest Login

https://github.com/iancleary/airline-check-in/blob/master/Southwest%2BCheck-In.py

Run the script 24 hours and 2 minutes before your flight. 
It will loop until Southwest allows passers to login.
The script logs in all users in simultaneously using parallel threads.

## Other Airlines
Development is halted until I have a use case for a scripted check in
